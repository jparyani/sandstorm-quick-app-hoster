# Sandstorm quick app hoster

This is meant for quickly/easily sharing .spk files with Sandstorm users.

## How to use

Run `gen_index.sh`, with the path to an .spk file on your filesystem.

Once it's done, upload this whole directory to a static hoster. A good one to use is [davros](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/8aspz4sfjnp8u89000mh2v1xrdyx97ytn8hq71mdzv4p4d8n0n3h). Make sure to enable static publishing.
